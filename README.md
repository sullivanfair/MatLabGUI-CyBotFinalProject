# MatLabGUI-CyBotFinalProject
This is a comprehensive collection of the code my group wrote for our Embedded Systems final project.  
In addition, this includes the files for the GUI I created in MatLab to control the CyBot remotely.  
My group members included: Aidan Gull, Connor Hand, and Zachary Scurlock.
