# MatLabGUI-CyBotFinalProject
This is a comprehensive collection of the code my group wrote for our Embedded Systems final project.<br>  
In addition, this includes the files for the GUI I created in MatLab to control the CyBot remotely.<br>
My group members included: Aidan Gull, Connor Hand, and Zachary Scurlock.
